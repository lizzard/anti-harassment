Noisebridge's Anti-Harrassment Policy
=====================================

This is a place for Noisebridge to collaborate on our anti-harassment
policy during the three-month-ish provisional period. File issues and
make pull requests, but please don't merge your own changes.

=====================================

Noisebridge is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or
space in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

Please realize that this many of us have different boundaries about sex
and porn. If it's important what you're working on at Noisebridge to talk 
about sex explicitly, for example, for a presentation at 5mof or a class, 
please give a bit of warning or notice.  Our ideal is to be considerate. 
San Francisco has a long history of sex-positive activism. That work can 
co-exist with a culture of respect and consent. 

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

People violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
space or the event at the discretion of any Noisebridge member.
